# ðŸ“Š Airline Booking Forecast
Forecasting airline booking data using Additive and Multiplicative models with MASE evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project predicts airline booking data using two models:
- **Additive Model**: Forecasts bookings by adding the average remaining demand.
- **Multiplicative Model**: Forecasts bookings by dividing cumulative bookings by the average booking rate.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Contains CSV files (input data)
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/ # Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for data analysis and forecasting 
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # Python scripts (.py) with core logic and model functions
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation 
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore # Excludes unnecessary files like pycache and checkpoints
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # List of dependencies for easy installation

## ðŸ“‹ Key Results
- **Additive Model MASE:** 0.63
- **Multiplicative Model MASE:** 1.63
