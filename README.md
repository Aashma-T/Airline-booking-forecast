# ðŸ“Š Airline Booking Forecast
Forecasting airline booking data using Additive and Multiplicative models with MASE evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project predicts airline booking data using two models:
- **Additive Model**: Forecasts bookings by adding the average remaining demand.
- **Multiplicative Model**: Forecasts bookings by dividing cumulative bookings by the average booking rate.

## ðŸ“‹ Key Results
- **Additive Model MASE:** 0.63
- **Multiplicative Model MASE:** 1.63

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
